# mContainers
This is a small set of data structures. Some are reimplementations of the C++ Standard Library for learning purposes, whilst some are my own implementations.

Currently implemented are Dynamic Arrays, Linked Lists, and Associative Arrays. Also included are mathemical vectors and matrices.
